## Most-optimal Skills
We can't get the same skills that high salary and high demand simultaneously. Becase from the results above, the difficult skills will get higher salary, but the amount of demand is not high. Otherwise, the easier skills pay lower, but have the demand in some companies. 
So, below are the most-optimal (high demand and high salary, sorted by salary descendent firstly) skills you need to learn!
